      Example: Assuming end-user doesnt know anything about unreal-device tool.
      How to use use "unreal-device load ..." command line.
    body: |-
      Step 1: understanding sample_devices_info format
          
          unreal-device info sample_devices_info
          
          Note: the structure of sample_devices_info is YAML syntax.
      
      Step 2: create a file as user_devices_info.yaml
      
      Step 3: load user_devices_info.yaml to unreal-device load user_devices_info.yaml
          
          unreal-device load user_devices_info.yaml
      
      Step 4: if user wants to save it for later uses, just add keep after load, e.g.
          
          unreal-device load keep user_devices_info.yaml
          
          Note: "load keep" will overwrite any existing device info.
              Use text editor to check the file
